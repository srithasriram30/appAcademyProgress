# Getting Started at App Academy

## Learning at AppAcademy

### How to Learn at AppAcademy

- Active learning vs passive learning

- Desriable dificulty => effetive practice should target skill as close as possible

- Use spaced repetition to learn

- Multiple sessions over long period of time

### Manage dificulty

- If too easy:

    1. Focus on code style, conventions and documentation
    2. Explore multiple approaches
    3. Teach others

- If too hard:
    1. Acknowledge challenge
    2. Actively engage with lesson
    3. Learn w/ others
    4. Reflect on what you learnt

### Documenting expectations

I already have some software development skills and knowledge, so much of this was not too new to me.

But I do know that there are some upcoming topics that I have had difficulty with in the past. So I need to make sure that I put in the effort to learn these topics and fill in my knowledge gaps.

There are also more topics that are new to me, and I hope that I would be able to learn them effectively.

## Intro to Problem Solving

### How to ask great questions

- 15min rule: if stuck for >15min w/ 0 progress, you are REQUIRED to ask qn

- Good qn: 1) specific, 2) clear and consise, 3) shows work you put in

- Try out code in REPL

- Google qn

- Check docs

## Data Types

### The Number Data Type

- encompases all no. (-12, 43, 3.19273, 7.0)

### Boolean Data Type

- two possibilites: true/false
- logical operations: and (&&), or (||), not (!)
- order of operations: ! -> && -> ||
- De Moragn's Law:
    !(A || B) == !A && !B
    !(A && B) == !A || !B

### Variables

- declare using let

- Initialise:

    `let bootcamp = "App Academy";`
- Declare
    `let age;`
- Assigning
    `age = 30;`

### String Data Type

- get index of given char using indexOf()

## Intro to Functions
### Functions

- set of code that runs when called
- declaration => fn is defined and saved to be used later
- invoking => calling a fn
- Fn def consits of `function` keyword:
    - name of function
    - list of parameters
    - code to be run
- Fn naming:
    - use camelCase

### Parameters and Arguments

- If extra arguments => additional ones ignored
- If less arguments => get error

## Control Flow

### Conditionals

- two parts => test condtion and expression

### Mutually exclusive conditions

- rule of thumb to have mutually exclusive conditionals in code (like a coin flip)
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

### Basic Loops

- two fundamental types: while and for

### Arrays

- can mix data types

- find element using indexOf()

- concat array using Array.concat()

- Array.push() => add element at end, Array.pop() => remove element at end

- Empty array: `let array = []`

# Setting Up Your Environment I

### Basic Terminal Navigation

- impt commands: pwd, ls, cd

### Moving around directories

- go to root: `cd /`

- commands have flags => can make them do different things

- arguments: specify which files/folders command should operate on

### Working with Files and directories

mkdir => create directory

mv => move files

`mv filename1 filename2`

cp => same syntax as mv, but copies files instead

rm => removes file, use `rm -i` for confirmation; rmdir => remove directories

*, ? => wildcards; * for zero or more matches, ? for one char

no trash bin for shell


## Intro to Source Control

### Source Control with Github

- create new branch: `git checkout -b "branchName"`
- go back to old branch: `git checkout "branchName"`
